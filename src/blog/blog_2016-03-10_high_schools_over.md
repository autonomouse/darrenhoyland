You know when Facebook started up and you kind of collect people you once met? I wasn't really as selective as I should have been... I ended up being 'friends' with this particular person from my tutor group in school. I didn't have any problems with him back then - he was weird, but then so was I\*. We weren't friends but he was a friend of a friend and I chatted with him on occasion, as you do when you're in the same tutor group.

So three or four years ago, this guy started putting the same comment on all of my Facebook posts: "Bore off Daz". The first one was about a link with a programming joke in it that I shared, so fair enough, he wouldn't have got it. Programming isn't for everyone, and I'm not sure what he does now, but it probably involves hitting some rocks with some other rocks. So fair enough, he didn't understand it and found it boring. Really imaginative, response. Oh well, not a problem - he wasn't exactly the target audience, but it was a bit weird that he'd go out of his way to expose his own ignorance and let me know that he found it boring, but like I said, weird guy.

Then he does it again on another comment. And again. And again. He keeps putting "Bore off Daz" everywhere. It's been a loooong time since anyone called me "Daz" and I'm not entirely sure how one would even go about "boring off", but never mind - the guy doesn't seem to like my posts. Okay, well, stop reading them then....

There's nothing wrong with the occasional bit of trolling when it's good natured, harmless and, y'know funny, but personally, I would have made it a bit less... um... boring. Stones and glass houses, eh?

Whatever, he's trying to wind me up. Fair enough, I responded a couple of times with a bit of banter and poked fun out of him back. Out of interest checked his public feed and saw that he'd repeatedly left "Bore off, xxxx" on two or three other people's comments - aw, he's coined his own little catch-phrase, I thought, how sweet. So then I just ignore him and delete his tedious comments as he leaves them.

But he continues to do this and it's just getting embarrassing. It's a bit like a small dog humping your foot: to ignore it any further would make a mess and leave you feeling violated; I could kick it, but then people who weren't paying attention will turn around and wonder why I'm booting a small, defenceless animal; Basically, there's no cool way of getting rid of it. 

In school, I remember him as being not very intelligent\**, kinda fat and *really* ugly and usually accompanied by this little kid that looked like a weasel - does this have any bearing on the story - probably not, he might have a few issues because of it all maybe, but I merely mention this because I do find it amusing that he is a troll in every sense of the word. Anyway, during his "bore off"-ing posting rampage, weasel-boy always 'liked' the posts. 

Then one day, on the 4000th occasion, a very good friend of mine from school, Pete, who was also (Facebook) friends with him also 'liked' the comment as well.

Up until this point, none of this bothered me in the slightest. It was like: *Monkey found stick, like prod Darren*. 

But Pete liking the post? That *did* annoy me. 

I opted to boot the small, defenceless animal. I thought really hard about it and came up with the best comedy response ever. I can't actually remember what it was I put now, and I can't find it because Facebook doesn't seem to have the ability to search for comments\***, but it was highly offensive and quite good, even if I do say so myself :-) 

He completely missed it - it was an obvious jibe and he didn't get it. Instead, he made some generic comment and then returned to the usual bore offs. It was like a battle of wits against a two year old. I came to conclusion that it wasn't even worth the witty replies if he didn't understand them. I think I then resorted to calling him a fat bastard. I don't even know if he's fat any more :-) 

Then it dawned on me that this guy was actually, seriously trying to 'cyber-bully' me! Really?! 

Ha, well, that's... um... unexpected. Meh, time to unfriend the loser. Problem solved.

You see, I've got this thing against bullies - always have. But in recent years, it's become a lot more focussed.

I was never bullied at school - im quite a proud person, I guess, and don't settle for this, so when a former employer tried it, I took him to a tribunal and the complaint was upheld. He's still there unfortunately, but at least it's a mark on his record the next time he tries to ruin a PhD student's life... 

Bronagh, Kei, Bill

the first was just a bad manager, the last 2 were psychopaths

its like every day yiu wake up in bizarro world


but that's another story

Unfortunately, it turns out that this particular problem was not yet solved after all. Every time I made a comment on Pete's wall, it would be accompanied by a "Bore off" from him there as well.

And still Pete 'liked' them. I realise that those unfamiliar with the internal politics of a social network that this sounds a little bit playground. It sounds somewhat childish - *"You betrayed me! How could you like his post!"* - simply because it is. I thought we were all above this.

But here's the thing - Imagine that you're walking down the street with a friend and there's a crazy person in their pants shouting obscenities at you. You look at your friend, pull a face and raise your eyebrows. You look back at the crazy person and laugh at them maybe, then you probably feel a bit guilty for laughing and you instead feel sorry for them. What you *don't* expect, is the friend that you're walking with to say, "Actually, I approve of and concur with everything that that person has just said about you".

The thing that bothers me is that this troll exposed a truth that is hard to swallow. Did I choose mt real friends poorly?

Pete lives in India ...

This was during a reunion - around xmas

I spoke to Pete about this and asked him to to feed the troll. I explained that if you was liking it as a joke, I'd rather he stopped, because it's getting kind of embarrassing now. I wasn't about to go and insist that people to unfriend other people, that's just ..., but I was close.

Another friend of mine from school, Phil, was there too. He said that I'd "lost" by rising to it. I said I wasn't even playing the same game as he was. The people he was trying to impress weren't the people I wanted anything to do with. I just wanted to insult him before I unfriended him.

That seemed to be the end of it.

Today, the troll did it again, but on comments made towards Phil. Despite Phil being there when I explained this all to Pete, PHIL PRESSED THE LIKE BUTTON TOO!

I was so annoyed I just unfriended Phil too\****. 

Now the obvious response should be to use that little report abuse link that I hear so much about, but the troll's not the problem. the problem lies with my friends who 'like' it. I hold my friends to a higher standard.

(Don't worry, I'll re-friend him once he works it out).

I'm a 35 year old man and this had pissed me off. I can only imagine what it's like being subjected to something like this as a kid. Being a teenager must have got so much harder...

If you come across a situation like this happening to other people, the best approach would be a display of solidarity with the recipient.





My experiences with work... Laugh at the bully. they hate that.










All of this just goes to show... 
didnt understand it before - i do now

it's about making people feel powerless. 



Flood your daily experiences with their hatred. In isolation, easy to shrug off. Day in and day out, it becomes a little harder. 



relentless

most of al its about those around you that stand by, watch and do nothing.

arent they my friends? why arent they poking fun at this guy for attempting this? 

if someone is down - barrage from all sides - no allies. well, you can see how dangerous it could be if done to a vinerable teenager.

I'm not powerless, far from it. If I see him....


but I'm probably not going to see him as we live on different sides of the country now. That's why he's doing it. 



I don't condone violence, but if when dealing with this kind of person when reason doesn't seem to apply, a well placed punch in the face would be tempting.

\* maybe not the same kind of weird, but weird none the less.

\** Seriously, I think he'd have a problem trying to spell 'GCSE'.

\*** I always thought Facebook was supposed to be a advertiser's dream zeitgeist-tracking machine, but either they reserve the special tools for those that pay, or it's just too hard for them to implement string searching accross their mega-database(s). I'm sure they have their reasons, but it's bloody annoying when your looking for something and it doesn't even provide this basic functionality.

\**** Doing that is a bit like expelling a country's ambassador - a bit of a useless gesture which makes it harder to communiate, but it show's you're pissed off. Well it would if he noticed. Perhaps I should inform him that I just unfriended him? Oh, I've not got any mechanism to talk to him any more. Oh well.
