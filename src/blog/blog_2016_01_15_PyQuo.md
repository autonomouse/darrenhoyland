Well, [as predicted](http://autonomouse.com/blog/strapdown-its-simple-but-it-works-kinda.html), that didn't last long.

I ditched Strapdown.js and reverted to my usual trick of making an elaborate, one-man, self-hosted thing called [PyQuo](https://github.com/autonomouse/PyQuo) - it's an GNU Affero GPLv3 licenced static site generator, based on Python3 that used Markdown syntax. Needs a lot of work, but it'll do for now :-)
