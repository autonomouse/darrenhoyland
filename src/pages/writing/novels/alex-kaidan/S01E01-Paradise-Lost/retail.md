    * 4.0 out of 5 stars
    * Lots of fun!
    * By J.M. Snyder on December 30, 2013
    * Format: Kindle Edition Verified Purchase
    * This was a short story that is obviously episode 1 (or chapter 1, if you prefer) of a longer saga. Unfortunately, the author doesn't seem to have written much more with these characters -- if he has, he isn't selling them on Amazon. The story could use a thorough line edit, and the author seems opposed to punctuation in dialogue, for some strange reason, but errors aside, I really found myself enjoying this story. I loved the witty banter and the interaction between the characters. I could really see the scenes play out as I read, and it reminded me heavily of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." I hope the author continues the adventures of Alex Kaiden, et al. They were a fun bunch and I'd love to visit with them again!

5.0 out of 5 starsIntelligently funny
By Matt on 6 Nov. 2012
Format: Kindle Edition
This is a well written first episode in what I hope becomes a long running series. Credit to the debut author for his easy to read writing style that should appeal to everyone.

Interesting concept and characters. Nice touch of humor thrown in. A serial without everything being a cliffhanger. I look forward to more installments.

Installment. Interesting plot, characters, with realistic but bad human behavior thrown in. I am going to read the next episode.

It was a fun read with a new premise about what happens after the destruction if earth. Only 37 pages, but enjoyable.
