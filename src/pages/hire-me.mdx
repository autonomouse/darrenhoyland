# Hire Me For Contract Work

If there is a big red "HIRE ME!!!" link in the header, above, then I am currently available for contract work.

I am a full-stack Python/JavaScript developer with years of experience, specialising in microservices, kubernetes and CI/CD.

I usually work remotely, but can be persuaded to work in London when the job requires it.

Please check out my [Curriculum Vitae](/cv) for further details. There are also links to LinkedIn, GitHub, etc in the header.

## Development philosophy

My philosophy for developing microservices concentrates on simplicity and readability, mirroring the UNIX philosophy of each service doing one thing and doing it well. While this does have the effect of shifting the complexity onto the infrastructure layer, technologies such as Kubernetes are designed to handle this gracefully and I have significant experience with deploying microservices onto Kubernetes and GKE. I also have much experience of building and maintaining CI/CD systems to manage deployment.

In addition to my back and front-end development, Kubernetes management, and CI/CD skills, I have also picked up a broad range of general skills related to API design, relational database schema design, use of queues (e.g. RabbitMQ), dev-ops, containerisation, infrastructure-as-code/gitops, sprint planning and management skills, amongst others.

On a final note, I would just like to add that I have worked from home for many years, and have been regarded as a productive and trusted remote worker, capable of full autonomy where necessary, while still remaining focussed on the purpose of the task (so while I can be independent, I still listen and won't go off and build something completely different to what is asked of me).
