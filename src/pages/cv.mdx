# Profile

I am a programmer, specialising primarily in Python and Javascript.

My earlier work was concerned with modelling biological systems, but has more recently tended towards data analysis and presentation, bug triaging tools, RESTful APIs, automation, and building and maintaining the infrastructure behind continuous integration systems.

I have a rigorous, methodical approach and always enjoy a good problem to solve. I have been praised for my analytical skills, expertise in Python, willingness to learn, enthusiasm, good humour, intelligence, and strong work ethic. While I am highly sociable and enjoy working around other people, I am sufficiently self-motivated to work remotely, and have done so for many years in my roles at Verne Global, Canonical, and Bitposter.

With a cross-disciplinary background, having a doctorate in computational neuroscience and degrees in informatics and biological sciences, I have experienced a range of working environments, from a large, multinational pharmaceutical company to academia to a globally distributed team of engineers: I have worked with people from all over the world and have been lab-based, office-based and home-based.

I currently live in North East Lincolnshire, UK, with my wife and two children. My hobbies include reading, writing science-fiction stories, and not going to the gym.

# Skill Set

## Python

* hpcDIRECT portal: Use of Python 3.6 and Flask (later ported to Sanic) to produce a collection of 17 containerised microservices, managed by kubernetes, for an API-driven customer portal and internal admin dashboard to deploy and monitor clusters of bare-metal compute nodes.
* OIL dashboard: Use of Python 3.5 and Django 1.7 to produce a dashboard for monitoring the current status of OIL and view historical results. This was adopted to become the main portal for QA's results and was used by the whole company, including C-level senior management, and was used to plan business decisions.
* Automated bug triaging: Designed and built a tool to parse OpenStack logs, normalise and analyse logs, and compare against known regular expressions to determine if a bug had been filed, and if not to determine how many test runs were hitting the new bug.
* Quality Assurance: Use of Python 2.7 (with Pytest and Python-Webdriver) to design and build an object-oriented test automation framework to automate the test coverage for the Turnitin SAAS platform.
* Morphometric Analysis: During my post-doctoral research position, I used Python to perform an analysis of the morphology of arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional anatomical structures.
* Bioinformatics: Using biopython, I performed a basic analysis of next-generation genomic sequencing data as a side-project for a Professor of genetics.
* Other Projects: In 2012, as a side project, I worked on a project to visualise complex financial packages as simple charts for a local financial investment company.

## APIs

* API design: I have planned, designed, built and tested many secure, RESTful APIs. These have been used internally and by customers, both directly as well as via front-end javascript dashboards and portals. To do so, I have used Flask, Sanic, and Django (Tastypie).
* Swagger (OpenAPI): Extensive use of Swagger to use, document and test internal and external APIs.
* Django REST Framework: I have used DRF on personal projects and during my time at Bitposter.
* APIs: Integrated internal- and external-facing SOAP and REST APIs into the test framework at Turnitin.
* Client: Have written Python wrappers around both SOAP and REST APIs.
* JenkinsAPI: Have written software that interacts heavily with Jenkins via it's API.

## Javascript

* Angular7: Set up, contributed to and managed the development of a portal written in Angular7.
* AngularJS: Web dashboard in AngularJS.
* NVD3: I used the angular-nvd3 npm library to convey information on test run data in simple and attractive, interactive charts.


## Leadership

* Management: In my role as Head of Platform Development at Verne Global, I managed a team and planned work on their behalf for each sprint, in addition to other administrative tasks.
* Collaboration: In my role at GlaxoSmithKline, I acted as the director and monitor for several drug safety assessment studies, which involved coordinating with external contracted organisations to ensure delivery on time and in compliance with regulatory bodies. This involved managing scientists based at external contract research organisations via email and telephone.


## Test Automation

* Selenium 2.0: Co-developed test framework and suite of tests to test large scale web applications based on Webdriver with Python bindings and Selenium Grid. Tests were written to follow the `Page Object' pattern and to be isolated, reusable, succinct and clear.
* Fitnesse-Webdriver Ports: Several existing tests were converted from Fitnesse into Python/Webdriver.
* Jenkins: Have managed several Jenkins servers in multiple roles.

## Other Technical Skills

* Ansible: Have written ansible playbooks and interfaced with portal to manage and monitor.
* Kubernetes, Docker and Helm: Have written Helm charts and gitlab-ci pipeline files to deploy microservices in Docker containers on Kubernetes.
* Juju: Built a layered-charm to be deployed via Juju (Canonical's modelling tool used to deploy, configure, scale and operate your software on public and private clouds).
* Agile practices: e.g. test automation, daily stand-ups (local and remote), continuous integration, code reviews, refactoring, version control.
* Linux: Familiarity with GNU/Linux and experience with common command ­line tools, shell scripting and server technologies.
* MATLAB: Used during PhD to develop an automated fitting tool for optimising unconstrained parameter values of a model neuron, run on a computer cluster. Also used during postdoc for cell tracking analysis.
* Java (JSP): Learned formally during MSc and have used to build a few simple android apps. I used JSP to build a virtual learning environment (VLE) for MSc dissertation.
* Postgres: Used Postgres 9.4 as database for web dashboard and wrote tools to backup, restore and synchronise the database which were integrated into Juju charms.
* SQLalchemy + Alembic: Have used SQLalchemy to interface with postgres, mariadb, and sqlite3 databases. Use of Alembic withing Flask/Sanic applicatiosn to manage migrations.
* Version Control: Have used git, bzr, hg, and svn extensively.

## Remote/Independent Working

* Remote working:  I have found that I am able to work effectively from a remote location, with a geographically distributed team. My positions at Verne Global, Canonical and Bitposter involved working completely remotely from a home-based office. I have used Slack, IRC, email, Google Hangouts, and Skype to effectively handle working with people spread across multiple time zones.
* Travel: At Canonical, I regularly attended "sprints" and attended conferences held in various locations throughout the world, lasting for a week or more.
* Self-motivation/organisation: In addition to a proven track record of working remotely, I have also successfully set and met goals and deadlines for various research projects, including PhD project and thesis write-up. I accept and handle responsibility well. I have been praised on my initiative and have much experience working without direct supervision. I have a tendency to document as much as possible for later use.
