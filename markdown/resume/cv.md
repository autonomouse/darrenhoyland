# Darren Hoyland
#### PhD, MSc, BSc

## Profile

I am a programmer, specialising primarily in Python and Javascript.

My earlier work was concerned with modelling biological systems, but has more recently tended towards data analysis and presentation, bug triaging tools, RESTful APIs, automation, and building and maintaining the infrastructure behind continuous integration systems.

I have a rigorous, methodical approach and always enjoy a good problem to solve. I have been praised for my analytical skills, expertise in Python, willingness to learn, enthusiasm, good humour, intelligence, and strong work ethic. While I am highly sociable and enjoy working around other people, I am sufficiently self-motivated to work remotely, and have done so for many years in my roles at Verne Global, Canonical, and Bitposter.

With a cross-disciplinary background, having a doctorate in computational neuroscience and degrees in informatics and biological sciences, I have experienced a range of working environments, from a large, multinational pharmaceutical company to academia to a globally distributed team of engineers: I have worked with people from all over the world and have been lab-based, office-based and home-based.

I currently live in North East Lincolnshire, UK, with my wife and two children. My hobbies include reading, writing science-fiction stories, and not going to the gym.

## Employment History

### [Verne Global](https://www.verneglobal.com/)

#### Head of Platform Development
#### 2017 - present

At Verne Global I acted as architect and lead-developer to create a public-facing Sanic-/Flask- and angular 7-based system (portal and API) to interface with OpenStack and deploy clusters of bare metal nodes optimised for high-performance computing.

An audit carried out by a third-party team of penetration testers stated that "No serious findings were found and the application is well structured".

I designed the microserivces architecture, packaged with docker and hosted on Kubernetes, and the REST APIs used (including the public facing hpcDIRECT API).

#### Key skills acquired and achievements from this position

* Technologies used include Python 3, Flask, Sanic, Angular 7, Docker, Kubernetes, GKE, Vagrant, OpenStack, Git, GitHub/GitLab, Vagrant, Ansible, Kayobe, LibVirt, Netbox, Hashicorp Vault, Rabbitmq, SQLalchemy, and Helm.
* As this was a greenfield project, I played a prominent role in selecting the technologies and tooling used, and in choosing setting up the infrastructure required. I also made a case for and specified the overall architecture, testing regime, policies, and procedures.
* I gathered requirements, wrote user-stories, and made design documents for the overall project and for each new microservice. I also gathered feedback and implemented requested features.
* Led a team of 1-2 front-end developers/designers (2 different contract developers and 1 contract designer).
* Liased with platform operations and networking staff, and coordinated sprint planning for my team.
* Evangelised the concepts of microservices, Test-Driven Development (TDD), code review, Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD), end-to-end testing and multiple environments to test upgrades prior to rollout.
* Set up prototype CI system using Jenkins and GitHub, and later assisted with migration to GitLab.
* Set up staging environments, including a virtualised OpenStack staging environment using Ansible and Vagrant.
* Wrote Python wrapper for Netbox API.
* GitOps/Infrastructure-as-code.


### [Bit Poster](https://www.bitposter.co/)

#### Software Engineer
#### 2017

At Bit Poster, I created several admin pages and management commands to integrate and synchronise between their various microservices.

Unfortunately, very shortly after starting, I was made redundant along with several others due to a much lower than expected investment round.

#### Key skills acquired and achievements from this position

* Technologies used include Django REST Framework, MongoDB, Postgres, RabbitMQ, and Vagrant.
* Test driven development.
* Python Microservices.
