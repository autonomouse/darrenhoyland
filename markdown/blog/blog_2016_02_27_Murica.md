- 'Murica
    - why so hard?
        - if you go about referring to your country as the land of the free, then you're held to a higher standard.
        - it's a good thing
        - we have our share of social problems
        - smartest folks I've met have been Americans (so have the dumbest - its as big as Europe)
    - differences:
        - religion
        - abortion
        - climate change
        - creationism
        - gun ownership
        - military worship
        - social welfare/healthcare
        - scientific literacy
        - justice vs vengeance



Turn on a news channel in America and you'll see why. It's been like this for years: anti-intellectualism, religious extremism and corporate propaganda manifesting in creationism, climate change denial, military worship, weaponisation of the home, destruction of any kind of welfare system for the less fortunate, and people who seem to be more interested in vengeance than justice.

When you carefully lay out all of your well thought through arguments in a research paper, and expect the opposing side to do the same, but instead of a reasoned debate they just come waving a bible at you, then what is the correct response? When funding research into their point of view failed to generate the results they wanted, rather than changing their stance, they instead fund PR firms to smear the scientists, how do you react? When every source of news is controlled by the right, but what they're saying does not correlate with the things that you and your friends experience on a daily basis, what's the answer?

The only thing left you can do to save your sanity is to laugh at them.  

This has been compounded by the internet, which by the way, most Americans now use to get their news from. The internet, as we know, is a little less well regulated than a news channel, so there's puns, jokes, and memes a plenty. 

It's not just the left though. It was only recently that I met a couple of very intelligent, right wing Americans that actually put forward coherent arguments to back up their point of view, without the usual dogma. I didn't agree with them, but it was nice to have the debate. The internet is a big echo chamber where you only visit sites that you're interested in, filled with people of the same persuasion already. The right get together and think the left is soft, the left gets together and think the right is short-termist. 

This is why its important to have unbiased news.
