I uploaded my first story (well, actually, the first episode of my story) to the Amazon Kindle Store. The series is “Alex Kaidan” (he’s the main character) and this is the first episode of season 1 (S01E01) and it’s called “Paradise Lost”. Yey!

Here’s the synopsis: Being completely unable to think of a sensible name for your space ship tends to be less of a problem when there’s only one ship in the whole Human ‘fleet’, besides Alex Kaidan only ever really borrowed it. What could be more of a problem is Earth having been paved and only a few Humans surviving, and that was only thanks to the actions of a benevolent alien race known as the Un. Alex and his crew have made it their mission to find and rescue however many Humans they can that are being held captive by any of the alien races. A mission made all the more difficult by the sad truth that a catastrophically decimated population is not an employers’ market.

Their mission, to save a large group of imprisoned Humans from being slightly too comfortable goes horribly wrong when Sara Heath, a member of his crew, shoots and kills a man.

“Paradise Lost” is the first episode in season 1 of the science fiction series “Alex Kaidan”.

Wish me luck…
