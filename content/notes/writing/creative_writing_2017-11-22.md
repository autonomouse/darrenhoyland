It's been a couple of months since I had my hair cut, being so busy at work and not having time at home 'cos I haven't seen the kids, etc, etc, so I just haven't had the chance and I'm starting to look a bit dishevelled. In fact, during a quick break on my journey from Grimsby to the office to central London, I stopped for a quick bite to eat at King's Cross and sat myself down and a tramp put 50p in my empty tea cup*, so it's time to get a haircut, I decide. 

I finish work about 6 and ask Google where a cheap barber is nearby that is still open. I walk in and inquire how much for a haircut and the guy says £35. 

I look behind me, expecting to see a party of five that have formed a queue behind me, but there is no one there. Realising the £35 is indeed just for me, I turn to run, but then I catch a glimpse of a scruffy looking desperado in the window. Alas, it's me. I sigh, and turn back to the guy, begrudgingly accepting the knob tax that all Londoners must pay for living in London and being generally Londony. 

He sits me down and asks if I want a beer. "Damn right I want a beer!" I snap, realising that I can maybe recuperate some of my lost cash by drinking it back, shortly followed by, "actually, better make it twelve". He returns with one. I move the beer to my lips, confident that, in London prices this is at least £6. I take a sip and, confused, I glance at the label: Efes Pilsner. That 17p in ASDA - Curse you, London! 

The barber, a 16-year-old*, homosexual, Polish gentleman named Mateusz or something asks me if I would like my beard trimming also. Morbid curiosity takes hold. I can't help but ask "Um.... How much would that be? Hypothetically speaking..."  

"Twenty p-" 

"TWENTY POUNDS?!?!" I exclaim. I've unwittingly turned into my mother. It passes. 

"Yes" 

"Um, no thanks," I reply. 

He proceeds to ask what products I use in my hair.  

"Soap", I reply, then quickly adding "Imperial Leather" to sound more classy.  

None the less, he shakes his head and then asks who normally cuts my hair, because they've done a terrible job, apparently. I explain that I have no idea - Whoever was working in the local hairdressers down Wybers, I suppose, then hastily add that it seemed like a relatively good job for seven quid and it *was* two months ago. 

Amazed, Mateusz continues with his work, painstakingly measuring and trimming my hair strands in groups of no more than four until the sides are done.  

"Are you sure you don't want your beard trimming?" Was the next question asked, "It is looking a little scruffy" 

"It's fine thanks," I reply, confident that I can find an Argos, buy a beard trimmer and still have enough left over for six Efes.  

The haircut continues for another twenty minutes, at which point Mateusz announces that the area around my left ear is finished, and perhaps I'd like to review his work and provide feedback on Trip Advisor before he continues on the area around my right ear. It's fine, Matty, continue! 

I glance at my watch, starting to think that, at this rate, it might even be worth it. I just have to stay in this chair until Tuesday. 

Sometime later, he moves on to the top of my head. Before he can continue, however, I must place my head on this bowl in front of my, shaped, not shaped entirely dissimilarly to a chopping block.  

Hmmm, okay. Free hair wash, I think. Wait - it's not free, it's a £28 hair wash! Still, that's at least seven different shampoos he's used. Not a bar of soap in sight. Oh, right, now I get a head massage. This is weird. Not bad weird. Just weird. Good weird. Actually, that's quite pleasant. Not *that* kind of good weird, but still good. Okay, ten minutes in - this is alright.  

I emerge from the sink and the drying process begins.  

"Yeah, go on then, I'll go for the beard trim too" 

Okay, so I just paid £55 for a haircut. But it did take 7.85 times longer than it normally does, so it works out about the same.
