The house had recently been redecorated, or so had said the estate agent. It was true, one wall of our new, albeit temporary, home had been painted and the best carpet that no money could buy had been laid in a single room. 

As for the rest of the house, it retained its "original features". That is, if you can refer to a forty-two-year-old carpet that had faded to a slightly less garish shade of pink to be a feature. Many more features could be found upon close inspection, such as the mass of dog hair which must have somehow survived the deep and thorough clean the agent had assured me that they had had. They would have been better off using 'Herbal Essences' - At least that way we'd be able to smell fruits of the forest rather than rear-end of a Rottweiler. 

Never one to miss an opportunity to have a nose, my wife liked to peel back the already peeling wallpaper to reveal even older paper still hidden beneath. We once wondered how far back we could go - if there were prehistoric cave paintings under ten thousand layers of wallpaper strata - but we feared for our deposit.  

The kitchen looked like it had been decorated with potential conversion to an operating theatre in mind: ceiling to floor in easy-wipe tiles, but not just any tiles, oh no. Green and blue and brown tiles. Colours almost deliberately chosen to drive even the most sane and mild-mannered cook to stick his head in the oven and turn it on. Maybe that's why the oven didn't work? Guess they were doing us a favour, although I'm sure they'd add it onto their bill. 

If you could get passed the tiles and the psychedelia themed carpets and the exposed walls and the cowboy wardrobes and the smells - the multiple, ever changing, untrackdownable smells - it was a hole. It took a while, but it became our hole. Our home. It'd do - we were together.
