Morphometric Analysis: During my post-doctoral research position, I used Python to perform an analysis of the morphology of arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional anatomical structures.

## [Newcastle University](https://www.newcastle.ac.uk/)

### Research Associate
### 2009 - 2012

My role as a post-doctoral research associate involved constructing three-dimensional computational models of developing cardiac cushions to enable morphometric analysis of mouse and human embryos.

Key skills acquired and achievements from this position

* Morphometric and bioinformatic analyses using *Python*.
* Conducted video analysis and developed a tracking programme for non-technical users in *MATLAB*.
* Alignment and computational reconstruction of histological tissue sections into a 3D model using [Amira](http://www.amira.com/).
