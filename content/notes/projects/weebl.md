Web App For OIL a.k.a. "Weebl"

OIL dashboard: Use of Python 3.5 and Django 1.7 to produce a dashboard for monitoring the current status of OIL and view historical results. This was adopted to become the main portal for QA's results and was used by the whole company, including C-level senior management, and was used to plan business decisions.

### Software Engineer
### 2014 - 2017

My role at Canonical was as a member of the [OpenStack Interoperability Lab (OIL)](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/04/01/infographic-OpenStack-interoperability-lab-explained) team.

OIL deploys thousands of OpenStack clouds per month, testing a variety of different combinations of hardware and software reporting on their interoperability, along with any bugs encountered.

### Key skills acquired and achievements from this position

* Technologies used include Python, Django, Javascript/AngularJS, NVD3, Postgres, Containers (LXC/LXD), Juju and MAAS.
* In January 2015, I was awarded a "spotlight award" for my efforts.
* I was the sole developer of tool a suite of automated bug-triaging and analysis tools (written in Python 2.7) for finding, collating and analysing OpenStack bugs, which has been in daily use in a production environment for two years, processing the results of millions of test cases.
* I was the initial and lead developer for the Django and AngularJS-based web dashboard used to monitor and present real-time and historical OIL status, including database, REST API and UI design and implementation (Django 1.7/Python 3/AngularJS 1/Tastypie).
* Maintained separate integration, staging and production environments with separate package repositories (PPAs and snaps).
* Strict adherence to code review, use of git and bzr with Launchpad and GitHub, and the use of merge proposals/pull requests.
* Packaged software as debs and snaps, and maintained several PPAs. Also developed and published a number of charms (for use with the Juju orchestration software).
