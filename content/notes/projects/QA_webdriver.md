* Automated bug triaging: Designed and built a tool to parse OpenStack logs, normalise and analyse logs, and compare against known regular expressions to determine if a bug had been filed, and if not to determine how many test runs were hitting the new bug.
* Quality Assurance: Use of Python 2.7 (with Pytest and Python-Webdriver) to design and build an object-oriented test automation framework to automate the test coverage for the Turnitin SAAS platform.

## Test Automation

* Selenium 2.0: Co-developed test framework and suite of tests to test large scale web applications based on Webdriver with Python bindings and Selenium Grid. Tests were written to follow the `Page Object' pattern and to be isolated, reusable, succinct and clear.
* Fitnesse-Webdriver Ports: Several existing tests were converted from Fitnesse into Python/Webdriver.
* Jenkins: Have managed several Jenkins servers in multiple roles.
