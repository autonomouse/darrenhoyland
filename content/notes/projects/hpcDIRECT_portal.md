hpcDIRECT portal: Use of Python 3.6 and Flask (later ported to Sanic) to produce a collection of 17 containerised microservices, managed by kubernetes, for an API-driven customer portal and internal admin dashboard to deploy and monitor clusters of bare-metal compute nodes.

<!-- hpcDIRECT portal

### Head of Platform Development
### 2017 - present

At Verne Global I acted as architect and lead-developer to create a public-facing Sanic-/Flask- and angular 7-based system (portal and API) to interface with OpenStack and deploy clusters of bare metal nodes optimised for high-performance computing.

An audit carried out by a third-party team of penetration testers stated that "No serious findings were found and the application is well structured".

I designed the microserivces architecture, packaged with docker and hosted on Kubernetes, and the REST APIs used (including the public facing hpcDIRECT API).

### Key skills acquired and achievements from this position

* Technologies used include Python 3, Flask, Sanic, Angular 7, Docker, Kubernetes, GKE, Vagrant, OpenStack, Git, GitHub/GitLab, Vagrant, Ansible, Kayobe, LibVirt, Netbox, Hashicorp Vault, Rabbitmq, SQLalchemy, and Helm.
* As this was a greenfield project, I played a prominent role in selecting the technologies and tooling used, and in choosing setting up the infrastructure required. I also made a case for and specified the overall architecture, testing regime, policies, and procedures.
* I gathered requirements, wrote user-stories, and made design documents for the overall project and for each new microservice. I also gathered feedback and implemented requested features.
* Led a team of 1-2 front-end developers/designers (2 different contract developers and 1 contract designer).
* Liased with platform operations and networking staff, and coordinated sprint planning for my team.
* Evangelised the concepts of microservices, Test-Driven Development (TDD), code review, Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD), end-to-end testing and multiple environments to test upgrades prior to rollout.
* Set up prototype CI system using Jenkins and GitHub, and later assisted with migration to GitLab.
* Set up staging environments, including a virtualised OpenStack staging environment using Ansible and Vagrant.
* Wrote Python wrapper for Netbox API.
* GitOps/Infrastructure-as-code.
