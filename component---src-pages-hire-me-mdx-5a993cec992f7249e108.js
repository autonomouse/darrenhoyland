The lack of gravity clearly did not seem to trouble them, nor did the vastly reduced air supply caused by the blast. Bulkheads would have been automatically sealed by now no doubt, but the sudden dip in oxygen levels should have caused anything not wearing a space suit, as he was, to undergo at least a temporary inconvenience. Both of these inconsistencies prompted Alex to speculate whether they had biologically adapted to a life in space.

While this information went some way towards helping him to understand why the sounds emanating from the translator resembled the sounds of chronic, multi-orifice flatulence, it was less than useful in a fire fight.

He was the one who had hired Sara. Not that there was much choice, but still it was him who had sent her on this mission. He knew she was a shoot first, ask questions later type - he had even privately admired her attitude at times. Even so, he could not believe that Sara would kill another Human.

He initially had his heart set on the \'Kaidan Maiden\' but his crew refused to paint the name onto the side of the ship until he came up with something better. It had turned out to be for the best - the amount of covert missions that they had undertaken where blending in as just another Un vessel had saved their lives since he had acquired the ship was becoming legendary back at The Village.

One stood out purely because of its size, dwarfing the others considerably. With no obvious landmarks nearby, and no sensory data, it was impossible to deduce the incredible velocities with which they traveled. Determining their size was almost as difficult, but a rough idea could be gained by looking at the windows, which were usually easy to spot when the inside was illuminated. The Pathfinders were known to be tall, with a typical individual being about one and a half times as tall as a typical Human male, and if conventional wisdom was to be followed, the windows would be about half this size. However, in this case, the crew had decided that the ships must have lots of tiny windows otherwise the ship would be almost impossibly large. It had a disc like structure with a central cavity hollowed out that could easily accommodate the rest of the ships in the fleet ten times over. As the viewing angle changed, they could see that there was a matching cavity on the other side, so that only a thin ring of hull separated the two sides.

There were now only four ships in the fleet, with another of the smaller ships having gone on ahead, accompanied by an escort of its own. Shortly thereafter, these ships found an appropriate Strachan current and disappeared, leaving the rest of the fleet in position.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"There they remained for some time. The crew, who were not exactly renowned for their long attention span under normal circumstances, waited patiently, just watching. Some stared at the massive ship, marveling at the scale or the ramifications of a race such as this who seemed to want nothing more than the annihilation of every last Human. The two engineers whispered to each other, comparing notes as they attempted to glean what they could from a visual inspection of its engines and exhaust ports. Alex just wondered if they had managed to come up with a name for their ship, before recalling that the naming of ships was a distinctly Human characteristic. They probably referred to it as \\\\u2018big scary ship with a dent in the middle\\\\u2019. Christian, meanwhile, had taken the opportunity to continue on with his calculations. Fortunately, the fleet was now positioned directly ahead of them so that they no longer had to crane their necks to see. It was also a lot closer and the details of the massive disc ship could now be made out much more easily. Their initial estimation using the windows as a guide would have been correct: this single disc ship would probably be larger than all of the Un\'s space-stations if someone glued them together.

It was called \\\\u201C2.1\\\\u201D. The \\\\u201C2\\\\u201D probably referred to it being part of the second fleet - he already knew that from the Nedic logs - and so the \\\\u201C1\\\\u201D must have meant that this was the flagship.

It took the crew a few moments to work this out, because this was not the same direction as where all of the ships had exited the stream. Strachan currents could lead anywhere in normal space so much so that it was theoretically possible to travel in one direction, enter a stream and then exit it directly behind the starting location, with the net result being travel in completely opposite direction. Strachan currents usually tended to be relatively local, astronomically speaking, but other than that, they could lead anywhere.

He unpaused it and the interior of the Nedic ship\\\\u2019s docking bay sprang to life as the Nedic engineers resumed going about their business. Watching the Nedic at work confirmed one or two of Alex\'s theories. Much like the shuttle they had liberated, the Nedic ship did not seem to bother with any kind of artificial gravity. Whether this was because they had not discovered how to induce local Higgs bosons in and around the devices that the Humans of The Village had come to refer to as \'gravs\', or if it was simply not required for a race with enough limbs to hold themselves in position while still being able to handle any controls, he did not know. The number of Nedic at work put Alex\'s crew to shame, or maybe it was the other way around as they seemed to be managing just fine with only two engineers. Using rings affixed to every surface, the aliens clambered over the walls and one or two were even on the ceiling. On closer inspection, another shuttle could be seen attached to the ceiling, hanging upside down. After a moments reorientation, the crew adjusted to the fact that it was only the ceiling from their perspective. As there was no gravity, the shuttle from which the new footage was being recorded from could have just as easily have been the upside down one. With the bridge being roughly similar in size to this shuttle, there was no stretching of the video required and so the illusion of actually being there was quite convincing. Or at least it would have been, had it not been for one Nedic who must have been doing some work on the shuttle in question, and was stood very close to one of the cameras. The result of this being projected onto the spherical walls of the bridge was that it looked as if a giant Nedic was attacking them from behind the captain\'s chair. The alien then disappeared from view, presumably having entered the shuttle, and it was moments later that the Pathfinder attack began.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The hull in front of the shuttle glowed briefly before melting in a straight line, exposing the docking bay to the vacuum of space. The pressure from the air forcing its way out of the tear caused the hull to rip open further, and several of the Nedic were swept out with it. Many more held on to the loops with one or more of their limbs. They may have been biologically adapted to a life in space, but Alex could not see them surviving for long once they were in a complete vacuum. The weapon, visible only by its trail of destruction, did not seem to have stopped there, however. As soon as it had melted through the hull, it continued on to hit two of the other shuttles and partially melt through an internal wall. Suddenly, as if the Nedic engineers\\\\u2019 prayers for air and warmth had been answered by an especially cruel deity, the internal wall exploded outwards, releasing superheated air that traversed the docking bay to egress through the tear into the emptiness of space. Alex guessed that this was probably the wall that separated the docking bay from the engineering section and that the weapon had warmed up something critical that did not particularly like being warm. Flames shot out from whatever was behind this wall, but strangely they did not stay there. The flames were detached from any surface and flew out into the void along with everything else like a fireball. A few seconds later, several more fireballs followed it. A second large explosion from somewhere deep inside the ship shook the shuttle showing them that the internal damage was enough that no further weapons fire from the Pathfinder warship was necessary, but a second wave was still coming: The projectile weapons that they had seen launched from the warship were yet to reach their target. Meanwhile, pillars of fire had now started to rise out of the various air outlets that were scattered around the docking bay, suggesting that the inside of the ship was undergoing some crisis that had caused the air itself to ignite in the heat. The lighting cut out so that the docking bay was now only illuminated by the pillars of fire from the air outlets, although these were diminishing - inevitably losing their battle against the insatiable demands of space. The other Nedic were undoubtedly now dead, still clinging on to the walls. Amidst all of this, the sole survivor in the recording shuttle took off and headed for the hull breach. The only silver lining for the pilot was that the tear was now sufficiently large for the shuttle to fit through, meaning that it would not draw the attention of the Pathfinders by opening the docking bay doors. Alex doubted that there would have been available power to do so anyway. \\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The crew watched through the shuttle\\\\u2019s cameras, in exactly the same way as the Nedic pilot would have done.

I\'m speculating that it must function like an anchor, which must be how they manage to keep their paths in place for so long. That means the Earth is just trapped.

Firing a laser in any direction but directly behind you would simply reach the edge of the field and then stop - at which point your ship would catch up to it, seeing as though every direction is forward, relativity speaking, you\'d effectively be shooting at yourself. Although, I suppose you could plausibly fire at someone following you. As for projectiles, they wouldn\'t leave the field.

The key to this, which Alex was quite proud of, was to prevent any heat leaking out. Normally larger ships would convert any excess heat generated from the engines and equipment back into a more usable form, or in the case of smaller vessels like the shuttle, radiate the heat away. However, Alex had had his engineers develop a mechanism to store the heat in canisters inside the shuttle for a time, and to retrofit it to the shuttles\' radiators.

The wrist console had built-in functions for compensating for the presence of gravity wells when sending laser pulses, and via his blatant hack of making it think that there was an impossibly shaped star close by, it did the rest.

As for sensors, he could only guess which they were, but either way, there didn\'t seem to be anything resembling a camera that was pointed directly at him. Even if there was, his shuttle was small enough so that as long as he did not block out any particularly obvious pattern of stars, they would have a hard time noticing him. Of course, it probably would not take too much effort to design a piece of software to constantly monitor the star field around them and flag up any regions where they became occluded in this manner, although he had to confess that neither Alex\'s crew nor the Un had ever bothered to write such a program themselves for such an edge-case when there were normally perfectly good sensors for checking for such things.

If he patched one into the other, he should be able to work out the size and distance of each of the ships in the fleet. Necessity really was the mother of invention.

What was he doing? The chances of detection were increasing with every passing second - doubly so now that there were two shuttles in the dim pink illumination of the forming path - and even if they did not detect either of them, the fleet was going to move on in a matter of minutes. Still, he made a second mental note to also have this written for future covert missions, but right now he could not wait. He needed to know. Now.

Finally, he knew the relative positions of each of the ships. His wrist console triangulated the distance of the shuttle from the disc ship and revealed that it was making good progress towards its destination. He began to prepare Christian\'s device that Gino and Ava had built and installed into the second shuttle in record time. Their plan to hit the field generator and sneak passed in the resulting confusion, depended wholly upon this device pinpointing its location. It turned out that most of the device that was going to help them save Humanity was a large box which apparently contained some relatively simple electronics. The rest of it was partially shielded and had to be welded onto the top of a spike sticking out of the front of the shuttle to reduce interference from it\'s engines. The device was programmed to automatically calibrate itself to the local conditions, but this did not account for the path\'s bizarre gravitational effect and so Alex had to do so manually. Once he had finished calibrating the device, all the while keeping one eye on his own position relative to the escort, the shuttle was close enough to the disc ship to begin its work. He had programmed it to perform it\'s duties automatically, but occasionally had to override it when he sensed it might risk exposing its presence. Suddenly, exactly as they had feared, the pinky light attenuated and the escort quickly pitched and turned around. The area with the least armaments, and as such the most windows, was then facing the disc ship with the shuttle in between. Alex did not risk moving it as that would make it more obvious. \\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Then, Alex realised that the fleet did not seem to be preparing to move on as he would have expected. \\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"It was not long before Alex worked out why they were not sticking to the pattern. Eight missiles had been launched from the nearby escort. For a moment Alex thought that they must have spotted the second shuttle. He felt like something was missing where the pit of his stomach normally resided, but it was nothing compared to the feeling he experienced as soon as the ship\'s console began announcing that it was being bombarded by laser pulses, the source of which being the missiles. They had targeted his shuttle, not the other one, and were arcing towards him.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Disregarding the fate of the second shuttle, he reactivated his shuttle\'s systems and ordered it to perform some semi-random weaves and dodges as he charged the field generator. But it was too late. Within seconds, the missiles hit - each with a deafening thud. There was however, a distinct lack of an explosion. Instead, he heard a drilling shortly followed by the shuttle\'s main power shutting down. It was not long before he realised that the missiles were acting as tugs and propelling him towards an air-lock on the disc ship. They were bringing him in alive.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"As Alex was slowly dragged towards his doom, adrenaline flowed through his body and panic began to set in. If he was an optimist, he could at least have found comfort that it had sorted out his headache much quicker than Rhyna\'s drugs ever did, but unfortunately he had also worked out that he was be unlikely to survive this. Clearly they could have just destroyed him instead of towing him in, so they must be curious. Uncomfortable with just hanging around and waiting for them to come in and torture information out of him, he racked his brain for an escape plan. If he died, he would never forgive himself for not trying. \\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"His hand shook violently as he moved it towards his wrist console. He forced himself to control his fingers long enough to be able to search for one of the less common alien races that had similar features to his own. There were not many, only one was really passable: The Chissta. They were of similar height, slightly taller maybe, were cellular and, while not being sufficiently advanced to have developed space flight themselves, they were intelligent enough to be able to pilot (and even steal) a shuttle such as this. This would be his cover-story. Even if they bought it, they might just kill him anyway, but at the very least it would keep them from knowing that there were Humans who were aware of their plan, roaming around the galaxy in their own ship. \\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Going against him was the fact that, while they did indeed have two legs, the Chissta usually only used one at a time. They also did not have arms and their feeding orifice was the only thing located on what would pass as a head. The head itself was surrounded by a large coronally oriented circlet structure. Another circlet surrounded their waistline. Alex had to think fast of his plan had any hope of working. He was going to have to improvise. \\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The waistline circlet was easy enough: He quickly peeled off the upper part of his suit and wrapped it around his waist, so that it was upside down with the arms dangling. The suit re-bonded to the other parts of it where it touched. Then he ripped some thin but sturdy tubing off of the shuttle\'s wall. It was probably doing something important but his current need was greater. This he threaded behind him and through the arms of his suit so that, once he had tied the ends of the arms together, it formed a loop with him in the middle. The problems of the absence of arms and presence of a circlet around the head resolved each other. When the time was right, Alex would simply touch his fingers together above his head, allowing his arms to make the loop. \\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Alex had been so busy that he had not noticed the interaction effect gradually increase, however a sudden surge in gravity that nearly pulled him to the floor signalled that the shuttle had already made it inside the docking bay of the disc ship, and they were now increasing their gravity to bring it down onto one of the landing pads. Alex killed the mini-gravs buried under the deck of his shuttle that normally kept him comfortably rooted there, and continued working on his disguise.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"He would have to draw attention to his mouth and hope they would not know enough about this obscure species to question the presence of the eyes. The Un fruit Rhyna gave him for the journey would do. It had left his fingers stained dark red from earlier on, so it could certainly be used to highlight his mouth and draw attention away from the rest of his face. However, he doubted that this alone would be enough to fool them into thinking he was not Human. He wished he had something to shave his hair off with but there was nothing handy. He racked his brain for a way to disguise his hair instead, and possibly also the rest of his head too. Then he remembered that in the medical kit was some spray on disinfectant used to sterilise wounds when out in the field. This left a white residue behind, so Alex grabbed it off the wall and then used the entire container to turn his hair and face white. He could hardly breathe by the time he was done, but he had no doubt that it would help to disguise his features. Finally, he opened the fruit and applied the red stain to his lips. It would have to do. \\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The shuttle violently landed on to the deck of the Pathfinder docking-bay.

In a matter of seconds it had simultaneously pointed each of these toward the door, and then begun to rotate as it burned a hole in the bulkhead that entirely encompassed the original Un-sized door. As soon as the lasers had finished their work, the thing pulled back with sub-tentacles still extended, taking a circular section of the hull including the door with it. The fact that the lasers were pointed outwards suggested that its masters clearly wished to gain entry to the shuttle but without without damaging anything on the inside.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Alex felt his mouth go dry as a Pathfinder entered through the hole. He was more than familiar with what the Pathfinders looked like. It was said that there were different configurations, but generally speaking, their shape tended to be bipedal with a relatively stubby torso and five arms, four of them on a plane at ninety degree angles to one another and a central arm, which also housed its communication organs. Each arm had three joints, and bifurcated at the ends with one branch containing a giant eye-like sensory organ and the other splitting into eight irregularly spaced \'fingers\' towards the ends. What passed for feet also stuck out in four directions at ninety degrees to one-another, so that there was no front. Alternatively, it would be equally true to say that there were four fronts to it. The whole thing looked like it was built up from many cubes of varying sizes with curved corners. If pressed, most Humans would probably admit to having spent at least one occasion staring at the image of a generic Pathfinder on a console and cursing their very existence for what they did to Earth, and for extinguishing any chance of Humanity ever being more than a foot-note in history. Many Humans blamed the Pathfinders in some roundabout way for any and every mistake or malady to ever confront them. In truth, Humanity had had no recorded interaction with the Pathfinders since the Earth was paved. Any Human unlucky enough to meet the giants - say for example, the sole pilot of a captured Un shuttle, who was currently dressed very strangely and who had quickly looped his arms over his head and stood, poised, on one leg just before it had entered - would surely succumb to their relentless desire to eradicate the Human race. However, despite knowing all there was to know, he was still completely unprepared for how big they were close up. Two other Pathfinders were waiting outside as even the Un shuttles would have difficulty accommodating three of them. \\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The imposing alien moved all of its sensory organs to look at him standing on tiptoes to make himself just that little bit taller and precariously holding his one-legged stance, arms looped overhead.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"Human!\\\\\\" called out the Pathfinder, aggressively and in perfect English, \\\\\\"I demand to know what you are doing here and why you are dressed like a ballerina?!\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Without emphasis or emotion, the speakers on Alex\'s helmet clearly broadcast the Chissta word for excrement.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, mdx(\\"strong\\", {\\n    parentName: \\"p\\"\\n  }, mdx(\\"em\\", {\\n    parentName: \\"strong\\"\\n  }, \\"Alex Kaidan will return in Episode 4: \\\\u201CEUAN HU\'S ARMY\\\\u201D where Alex, captured and interrogated by the Pathfinders, will come face to face with one of Earth\'s deadliest killers, and the fight for future of Humanity will truly begin...\\"))), mdx(\\"hr\\", null), mdx(\\"p\\", null, mdx(\\"em\\", {\\n    parentName: \\"p\\"\\n  }, \\"Thanks for downloading this Ebook.

There were also more tangible concerns, like what they were going to eat. While sharing these problems and helping where he could, such as in the planning and layout of the colony, Hans Strachan immersed himself in the study of any piece of Un technology he could find. The Un had left plenty lying around on their moon so that they could artificially foster the right pressure, gravity and atmospheric conditions within the dome required to keep the Humans alive. Strachan thrived under the desperate conditions and applied his talents wherever they were needed. Once the initial problems were overcome, Strachan began his work in earnest and managed to deduce the mechanism and functions of most of the Un equipment that generated the dome around the colony. Initially the Un did not wish to divulge the workings of any but the most basic of their technologies, but after a few years, he had managed to negotiate a treaty of scientific cooperation with the Un.

However, in the few centuries following the arrival of the Pathfinders into this part of space, a series of accidents, scandals and disasters forced them to bow to political pressure of the other races to abandon many of these worlds and the Un civilisation had slowly regressed to the point where they now had official claims to only three other planets in addition to their home-world.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Despite their long history of interstellar travel, the Un had never mastered the complexities of the streams.

This had meant that a round trip often took ten times longer than it did now and was fraught with danger as the ships could exit the stream anywhere.

It began to dawn on Alex that they were probably built by hand out of the only local materials available, and not with the help of the Nedic.

The pillars were far more intricate and ornate than any of the other buildings and it was obvious to Alex, even from a distance, that they were created using more advanced technology and materials not available to the local populace.

In addition to this minor setback, he is out of contact range of his crew, one of the shuttles has had a rather large hole cut into the hull and the other shuttle has been left aimlessly floating around in space. Worst of all, Humanity\'s mortal enemies appear to have mistaken him for a cross-dresser. Needless to say, he is having a really bad Thursday.

At one point, he managed to punch one of his captors in a nodule below its central communication organ and it had to go and sit down for a few minutes. Had Alex calmly accepted his fate, he probably would not have ended up so battered and bruised. The injuries he attained were not dispensed out of malice or aggression, but were rather a result of curiosity. They clearly found amusement in the small Human\'s fight and he was passed around between several of the giant Pathfinders. In the course of joint examination, Alex\'s injuries came from being picked up, turned upside down, his limbs pulled and body prodded. It was the type of investigation that could only be performed by those who simply had no thoughts of care for the well-being of their subject. Despite the goal of the Pathfinders being proclaimed to be to wipe out their mortal enemy: Humanity, it seemed that not many had actually seen a Human before. What was even stranger was that Alex\'s galactic translator did a good job of conveying that not many had even heard of Humanity either, but this was before his wrist console had been ripped off of his arm. The one exception to this was the Pathfinder that had entered the shuttle initially. It paid him little further attention, clearly having seen Humans before. Alex was still trying to work out how this Pathfinder spoke Human-English so well, not to mention just what, exactly, a \'ballerina\' was.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"These events took place in what could technically be described as a docking bay, however, it was more akin to a metallic cliff looking out over an unending artificial landscape that stretched out as far as the Human eye could see either side, with the inside of the hull on the other side of a huge chasm in front of him. If Alex had been paying attention, he would have seen a hive of hexagonal structures imprinted into the wall that faced the outer hull. Each side of each hexagon, including the one he had landed on generated its own local gravity field, and was designed to house up to three shuttles, although the vast majority were empty. However, most of this was lost to Alex who had not paid much attention to his surroundings as the shuttle was forced to land. He was too busy applying his cunning disguise, one which made him feel somewhat silly for trying to pull off now. It would seem that the Pathfinders were not as gullible as some of the other races. At the very least, he had not irreparably damaged his suit in the process and he was able to put it back on and partially reseal it, which helped to keep him a little warmer against the bitter cold of the room.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Once each of the aliens present had finished having look at him, they had carried him from the captured shuttle to a room not far from the docking bay. Of course, this was not until after they had spent some time carefully selecting a bag of appropriate size to shove over his head - the first three were too small and one of the aliens had to leave the room to go and get some bigger ones from elsewhere in the ship. Despite everything, Alex managed to take heart from the fact that it was not only his crew that needed to get their act together.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"At this point, he had not yet quite managed to wear himself out wriggling from one of the alien\'s grasp, and started using up the last of his energy pacing around the brightly lit room. The only emotion that he felt to start with was anger. Anger at being examined, anger at being imprisoned, anger on behalf of his whole species for being gradually exterminated, even anger at now being ignored and left to rot. With there being no Pathfinders nearby available to pointlessly wrestle against, he had begun to punch the cell door until his fists were bruised and ached.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"After this initial bout of enthusiastic self-harm, his energy began to subside and he began to plan his escape. For a while, he managed to convince himself that he had gotten himself out of worse situations before, and could get himself out of this, once he just set his mind to it. He continually scanned the room, looking for a flaw. Despite its large size and barren nature, it still somehow managed to make him feel claustrophobic. It may have had something to do with the height of the ceiling, being far taller than any room on a spaceship had any right to be. The door was equally imposing, obviously having been designed to accommodate the height of the Pathfinders. It was as solid and immobile as the walls, which were perfectly smooth to the touch and, other than the delineation of the doorway, were completely featureless. There was a dim, soft light that did not seem to emanate from any single source, and Alex wondered if it was being generated by the walls themselves. There did not seem to be any way of escaping.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Eventually, sheer panic took hold of his thoughts once more, and he almost considered asking a god for some kind of help. He wondered what he could offer in exchange for a few more years: that he would be a better person, that he would be nicer to Liam despite him being a weasel, that he would actually go and visit his fianc\\\\xE9e next time he was back at The Village... but the realisation that he probably would never return there hit him even harder. He was not sure which god he should be asking anyway. From the sound of it, they were quite picky about only believing in one of them and not the others. Besides, he had not needed their help before and he could not help but feel that if he cashed it in now, that would make him a hypocrite, and they were probably sent to hell or something. Right now, death did not seem far away and so he did not want to mess anything up now.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Instead he slumped to the floor and ran through the actions that led him here in his mind. Had he been too careless in piloting his shuttle? Was there a better way he could have controlled the second shuttle that would have allowed him to stay out of sight? Was there anything else he could have done to escape the missiles that had been fired at him? He ran through the possibilities a hundred times, but it was all just pointless. Why had he even bothered? Why had he not taken Ava\'s suggestion to run away to the Nedic planet seriously? Dann certainly would have been happy there, Reza might even find his parents somewhere, and Liam would fit right in as a Nedic worshipper. Why was it that he always had to play the hero when it usually got him into life-threatening situations? He thought of Rhyna and how they met. His crew. His colleagues. His friends. He would never see them again.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"As his hopes plummeted, so too did the temperature in the room, while the gravity increased rapidly, and he began to cry. Not for long though. He had to pull himself together. Whatever would the genocidal aliens think of him?\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"If he was going to die, he would at least do so honourably. He would not give up on his crew. If they were going to torture him, he would see how long he could hold out for. So he sat there, saving his energy to allow him to resist for as long as he could. Despite all this, there was no longer any thoughts of escape. He was in no way restrained, but the cold and intense gravitational field now all that occupied his mind and was more than enough to keep him still, curled up in a ball on the deck by the wall.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"After an indefinite amount of time, he felt the gravity reduce to something more like that on the ship he was used to.

They seemed to have based their whole culture around painstakingly calculating the odds of every outcome before making any kind of decision. They did not seem to have any kind of gut feeling. Still, it could well have been this that saved Humanity. As the years passed, Humans had quietly begun to speculate amongst themselves that the Un were studying them and had rescued them because they realised the chances of surviving the Pathfinders alone were slim. Of course, this may have been a gamble that was about to backfire as if the Pathfinders knew about The Village, then they would be gunning for the Un next.

Strachan currents were notorious for not going where you wanted them to go, so every trip back home usually ended up with them emerging somewhere close to each of the planets and moons the system had to offer. Prior to Hans Strachan\'s seminal work, long journeys from an exit point to a planet using standard propulsion were commonplace. It was well known that a Strachan current could lead to anywhere in space, although they did tend to stay close to regions of gravity (so while you could usually be reasonably confident that you would not end up stranded far from the galaxy, or in between the spiral arms), so Strachan currents tended to pass close to planets. The problem was that that was not necessarily the planet you wanted. These days, Alex was skilful enough to find another stream within a solar system, but it would depend on what was available and predictions were not always accurate, so he had seen his fair share of deep space too. Things were not always this way, however. Shortly after acquiring the ship, he and Dann had correctly put Yona Stev\'s instructions into practice to make a short journey away from the Village, but then they had been completely unable to find another Strachan current to bring the ship back home. The streams were transient by nature, but a combination of bad luck and inexperience meant that after they had exited while still within the system, they were then unable to find it again, or any other in the area. He and Dann travelled far using propulsion alone and nearly starved to death, before finally managing to find a way back home. It was then that they decided to get a bigger crew than two. The logic being that having other people dedicated to the many tasks required to keep the ship operational would free Alex up to concentrate on finding the next Strachan current. And if they weren\'t able to help them out of a similar situation in future, at least they could eat them.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"During his travels throughout the Un primary solar system, Alex had never come across any defences other than what was normally found near a busy space port. While it was true that the Un did such have satellite- and ground-based cannons positioned on their planets and the moon which was home to the Village, as did all of the populated planets, they had nothing that could provide any resistance to what the Pathfinders were bringing. There were no weapons arrays elsewhere in the system and there were certainly no minefields.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Of course, the question was, would it be better to pretend the Un had nothing at all, thus taking the Pathfinder fleet by surprise when they encountered the meagre defences they did have?

To his right was nothing but an empty and perfectly straight corridor that seemed to stretch out to infinity. To his left, he could see the back of the Pathfinder. He quickly ducked back into the room and waited. While the Pathfinder did actually have an eye facing behind it, Alex was confident that it was not looking directly at him before he quickly retracted his head. The sudden change that accompanied his swift movement outside and back in again made him momentarily dizzy. He felt heavier inside the room, suggesting a highly localised gravity field.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"He gave it a few moments, then stuck his head out of the doorway once more to see that the Pathfinder was no longer there.

His suit was torn beyond repair, he was bruised all over and he really needed to pee.

Then again, once it checked his facts, it would soon discover that he made it all up (He was particularly pleased with the concept of the \\\\\\"athlete\'s foot\\\\\\" biological doomsday weapon). This was his only chance and he had to take it.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"He ventured out and turned the opposite way to that which the Pathfinder went and started to run. As he did so, he checked the ceiling for anything resembling a security camera. Fortunately, he had not seen any yet, or more to the point, none would have seen him. After several minutes of running in the same direction down the never-ending corridor, it became clear that he would have to turn soon enough - this would be the first place they would look for him - but how could he when every door he passed could potentially reveal a room full of Pathfinders? Eventually, the corridor split into two. He stopped just before the branching corridor and stood with his back to the wall, taking the chance to both rest and peek around the corner to see what was down there. It looked exactly the same as the corridor he was on. There were still no Pathfinders to be seen. They were big, but even they would have great difficulty filling a ship this size.

If the other alien had seen him, it would probably report to the others, rather than chase after him. He would need to be vigilant. And he needed a better plan than running aimlessly down the corridors. Much to his relief, the wall revealed itself to be a T-junction of yet another corridor.

No, that did not make sense - surely if they were going to gas him, they would be here to collect him by now. He had been dreaming - R.E.M. sleep so that was likely to be twenty minutes, at least.

He picked himself up and as he did so, his headache intensified to the point that he had to steady himself against the bulkhead to prevent himself from falling down again.

As he walked, Alex relaxed a little and one might go so far as to describe his gait as a \'leisurely meander\' through the ship. It was not that he was suddenly immune to the fear of capture and torture, but he now knowing that if he over-exerted himself by running or panicking, he could end up passing out once again, and that would put him in even more danger, so he just walked, and took the opportunity to look around. It was all quite liberating really.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Three or four turns later, he saw some mysterious iconographics next to a line that started thick and tapered to a point.

He absent-mindedly began to trace the curvature of one of them with his finger in an effort to kick-start his imagination, and as he touched it, a box around that particular set of symbols glowed a lighter shade for a moment. This was immediately followed by the section of floor he was standing on lifting up. Quickly, he leapt off the platform to the deck just before it entered a newly formed hole in the ceiling. Being unprepared, the fall twisted his ankle slightly, so he sat on the floor as he watched the hole in the ceiling reform itself and a second platform rise up into the recess left by the first in the deck. So, this must be an elevator of some kind. And the symbols were most likely destinations throughout the ship.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"Makes sense,\\\\\\" mused Alex.

With the exception of the Un, and only because they seemed to find pleasure in associating probabilities to everything, it would not be apparent to the other races to focus their observations on the small area in the front of the Human head and to associate the position of the visual sensory organs, the movements of the feeding orifice and the colour of the skin over time with their emotional state.

Time to meet your ancestral enemy.\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Alex felt a chill through his body as he turned his head to look at the smaller door.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"As it slowly opened, the Pathfinder talked about his recreation absent-mindedly, \\\\\\"I hope I got the specifications correct. There was only so much I remembered and only so much data we had retained in the archives... \\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"A noise came from down the small corridor behind the door. It was dark, but Alex was certain he heard the low pitch, grumbling of some soon to be revealed beast. There was nothing he could use to defend himself from it, other than his own body, so he prepared himself to give it an almighty kick in the head, assuming it had one. He inched closer and moved to the side of the tunnel entrance. He reasoned that if it was anything like Humans, and cows as he had also recently discovered, a force to the head should be effective in rendering it unconscious, if only he could land a well-placed blow.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"But Alex could not bring himself to do it. Fear overcame him and he backed away from the tunnel entrance.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Eventually the savage beast entered the room. Alex first noticed the eyes. They were the eyes of a natural hunter, both facing forward, focussed into a predatory stare. He caught a glimpse of teeth, designed to rip flesh. Its ears were sharpened to a point, and it had a twisted, curled tail. It\'s menacingly soft, fluffy fur covered its ferociously tiny frame.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Alex backed up against the wall as the monstrously cute animal aggressively trotted towards him.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Something prevented Alex from defending himself. At first, he believed that he was paralysed by fear, but as the nightmarish creature began sniffing his leg, for some reason, he could not bring himself to kick it.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"After a quick sniff, the creature lifted itself on its back paws and latched it from legs around Alex\'s own. Alex tried to shake it off, but it hung on and then began to rhythmically move back and forth.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"Argh!\\\\\\" screamed Alex, for a short while, until he realised that it was not trying to rip his foot off at all. In fact, it seemed to be doing something entirely different.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"Mwahahaha!\\\\\\" bellowed the Pathfinder as the miniature poodle continued to grind away.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Alex was not sure what to do. Humanity\'s natural enemy did not appear to be particularly difficult to fend off, should Alex choose to. It did not, however, seem to be particularly interested in devouring him after all, in fact, it seemed to be quite enjoying itself. Meanwhile, Alex could not help but notice that the small door was still open.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The manic laughter coming from the Pathfinder stopped once it noticed that Alex had begun to crawl on all fours into the tunnel, but it was in no position to stop him. It had clearly assumed that the beast would have ripped him to shreds by now. Instead the beast in question clung on to Alex\'s shin as he made his escape.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The tunnel led to a giant room that was filled with equipment, but had the unmistakable character of a laboratory. Directly in front of the tunnel was an open area fenced off by transparent walls that came up to Alex\'s hip, clearly designed to keep the Earth animal that Alex would later learn was called a \'dog\' from going in any direction other than into Alex\'s cell. As soon as he had crawled out of the tunnel, the dog ceased its activities and suddenly became very scared. When he stood, it chose to hide in between his legs, as opposed to trying to copulate with them. Beyond the short wall were rows and rows of scientific machinery, the closest one feeding into a sliding door in the wall. If the Pathfinder was to be believed, this must have been the machine that had just printed out the dog, layer by layer. It did not sound like a particularly pleasant way to be brought into the universe, and so Alex did not blame it for being so scared by this room. Other than this biological-printer, the machines seem to be separated by type. While his eye was admittedly untrained to much of it, there were alien plants growing in this section, bubbling liquids in another and various optics scattered around a third. As he scanned the room, he noticed a Pathfinder in one of the far sections and he ducked down quickly, nearly squashing the dog.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Knowing that his time was very limited, he risked a peek to find that the Pathfinder scientist was still in the same location, although it had all of its sensory organs pointed towards the bench, and so was clearly absorbed in some experiment or other and had not yet been alerted to his presence.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"With only minor difficulty, Alex pulled himself up and over the wall, and landed awkwardly on his already-injured foot. He ignored it and started to move away, but the dog began to whine and scratch at the wall. Not wanting to draw attention, he pulled himself up once more and scooped it up into his arm, in much the same way as the Pathfinders had to him earlier on, and they both dropped back onto the floor outside of the transparent walls.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Still carrying the dog, Alex bowed down low and quietly ran in the opposite direction to the Pathfinder scientist. After several minutes that felt like hours, he saw a door slightly to his left of the massive room in the distance. However, as he moved towards it, he noticed a device on the far bench that did not seem to belong there. Being unable to resist, he took a longer look. It was undoubtedly a piece of Sereti technology that had wires of more Pathfinder appearance attached to it, signalling that it must have been undergoing some kind of automated analysis. He stopped and looked around. It was not alone. There were several other \'out of place\' items, and Alex realised that this was the end of a section that seemed to be devoted to the study of, or maybe just for gathering intelligence from alien artefacts.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Instead of moving towards the door, he instead turned into this section. The dog obviously did not think that this was a good idea, as it buried its head in his elbow, but Alex saw an opportunity. With no Pathfinders in sight, he perused through the items hoping to find his wrist console, or at least something that he could use. He picked up a Nedic personal terminal, hoping that his recent experience with Nedic shuttle\'s might help him, and to his delight, realised that there was an Un console lying underneath it. He grabbed the device and activated it. It reported that it was low on power, and that its full functionality was restricted to the owner of the device who Alex doubted was still alive to be needing it, but he could still use its guest functionality to allow him to use it to locate his own console.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"He put the animal down, which chose to return to between his legs, and requested that the console try to communicate with his own, using standard frequencies. It would no doubt give away his position to anyone who cared to be listening, but it was already obvious where he was. There were not a lot of places he could be hiding: Once through the tunnel, there was nowhere else he could have gone other than this room. What was surprising was how long it was taking his captors to come and find him. It must be a very large ship, with very few Pathfinders indeed, if it was taking them this long. The scientist, possibly too absorbed in its work, must not have been interested in such pursuits.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Finally, his console replied. It was still functional. Giving his authorisation key, he activated the camera and noticed that its surroundings were very similar to his own. Deciding the risk was worth the while, he set it to produce an audible ping every five seconds in the hope that he would be able to hear it. The power on the Un device failed, but a quiet ping from not far to his left reassured him that it had managed to send this final command before it did so.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"When Alex found his console, it was wired up to the Pathfinder machine in the same manner as the Sereti device had been. He was close to ripping it out, but the thought struck him that if it was plugged into their machine for analysis, they probably were not expecting it to analyse back. Sure enough, when he ran a few basic, exploratory commands through it, the Pathfinder system naively obliged. Alex thought about how the Pathfinder had implied that Humans were the only ones that wrote viruses. He certainly knew of no other race that did it. If that were the case, he imagined that there would be very little defensive programming done within their system. Unfortunately, he had already spent far too much time here, and he did not have time to craft a custom-written virus. What he could do however, was deploy a couple of his old favourites. He quickly installed a small script that would remotely grant him a back-door to the Pathfinder system through this machine and another which would analyse their network and try to work out a few commands. He left them running as he put the console back in its rightful place. It was not long before it got to work by injecting the much overdue haem vesicles into his arm.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"As he detached the final wire from it, he heard high-pitched clicking between several Pathfinders. He looked at his planned escaped route, only to find that it was from that direction that four of them had entered the room. One walked differently to the other three and he could instantly tell that it was his interrogator. They had not seen him yet, so he ducked down as low as he could until he was level with the dog that was still following him, clearly deciding to take its chances with him over the alien giants.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Alex checked his console to see if the scripts had managed to find anything resembling a map. It helpfully loaded in some schematics of the ship it had found into a familiar navigation program. While the information was still incomplete, he could see fairly well how to get to the excessively large shuttle bay. He programmed in the longer, slightly convoluted route to avoid the compromised door and the bench with the scientist. He worked fast and was only distracted, briefly, when the dog started to lick his face.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"Okay, whatever you are, that\'s just creepy.\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"It wagged its tail and, when Alex started to swiftly and stealthily follow his escape route, it followed along.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Now that Alex had an idea of where he was going, he moved fast. If the Pathfinders saw him leave the room, then they could not keep up with him now that he had enough oxygen flowing through his arteries. He also had his wrist console inject an analgesic to allow him to fully ignore the pain in his leg, although the adrenaline may have done the majority of the work for him already.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"His route led him through the now familiar-looking corridors down which he had previously run, but he only used the elevator platforms when he needed to change levels. He only had to stop on two occasions. The first was when he realise that the dog could not keep up without the oxygen infusion and he had to go back a few metres to pick him up. The second was when his path led him up to a door that was not as obliging as the one that led from the alien laboratory.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Alex figured that they had finally begun to implement some basic security measures and had closed and locked the doors. Unfortunately, his wrist console informed him that this particular door was the last thing that stood between him and the shuttle bay. He checked for an alternative, but found none. Instead he used his wrist console to access the machine he had compromised earlier via his back door.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"As a terminal for conducting scientific analysis it had no special privileges, but the Pathfinders had given it direct access to other machines that had. Alex could only speculate on why they would do such a thing. It was probable that they had become complacent and had wanted the analysis machine to be able to upload its data to a central server, and doing this had been the easiest method. He noted that their system was more than capable of correctly securing itself, but the Pathfinders had not only ignored these security measures, but actively bypassed them for an easier life. Little did whichever one had done this know that it would be the key to Alex\'s escape.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"He scanned through its recent actions and found what he translated to be the most likely looking command to upload data to a central server. The server\'s address was a sequence of octal numerals, using which Alex was then able to access the server directly. Having no idea how to ask it to open the doors, Alex ran an automated analysis script to try to find out the commands he could give it. The console took a while gather and process this information, during which time Alex had to stand there, doing nothing except to look nervous. He was so close. If he could get through this door, he had a chance of freedom. Back there was only death and the Pathfinders, while not fast, were definitely coming.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Finally, the console reported back that its analysis was complete. It had limited access to the ships systems, including internal door control. He opened the door and saw several shuttles. For some reason, he thought there might have been more, but disregarded this thought for now as he ran to the nearest shuttle. As he did so, he ordered the door that he had spent so long trying to open to be closed and locked behind him. Once again, there were no Pathfinders present.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Now that he had a wrist console, complete with analysed protocols for the Pathfinder systems, he felt confident that he could pilot one of their shuttles. Alex approached the closest one and stopped at the door. Above his head was a platform that led to the entrance to the shuttle. Presumably, there were some kind of stairs somewhere that the Pathfinders would normally use. They were big, but not this big. Alex did not have time to find them and so he simply leapt up and grabbed onto the ledge. Realising that he would need his other hand in order to pull himself up, he swung the animal up above him onto the platform. It would not be fair to refer to the manoeuvre as a throw, but the thud with which the animal landed followed by a slight whimper suggested that it was not quite the graceful and dignified placement that Alex had planned. Now that he had both hands on the ledge, he was able to pull himself up.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"Sorry about that,\\\\\\" he said as he walked up to the open entrance way. The dog did not follow this time. Alex stopped and looked back, \\\\\\"You coming or what?\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The dog took a moment, presumably to be weigh up its options between giant, alien monsters and throwey-Human person, but eventually decided to give Alex the benefit of the doubt. It forgivingly trotted back to his side. Alex rolled his eyes and they both entered the shuttle.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Once inside, Alex looked for the pilot\'s seat to no avail. The entire shuttle was simply a single cavernous space with no chairs, windows or terminals. Presumably, they gave the shuttle commands via some kind of remote console, not too dissimilar from his wrist console. He tried it out where he stood, and he successfully managed to use it to access the shuttle\'s systems. Once again, he deployed the script for creating a back-door to the shuttle\'s systems. He already had access via the main ship which he had previously compromised, but he was planning to be out of range as quickly as possible and was not sure if the connection would need to be reverified after once this had happened. He did not like the idea of losing access to the shuttle when he was out in deep space. He might be forced to eat the dog or something. While the script ran, he did what he could with what he had. He activated the lights and sealed the door closed. That was the easy part. Increasing the temperature and oxygen concentration to something that they found more comfortable was a little harder, and as much as Alex would have liked to have corrected the gravity setting, he had no idea where to start. Besides, his script had now finished running, and he had wasted far too much time on creature comforts already.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"After a brief period of time familiarising himself with the commands returned by his script, he was confident that he could fly the shuttle. He was delighted to find that the ship obliged when he requested the outer doors to open.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Alex had not yet worked out how he was going to escape the same fate he had the last time he was floating around outside a Pathfinder ship, or more likely a worse fate now that they had already decided to get rid of him, but he knew it was only a matter of time before they caught up with him and he felt the need to be mobile. He ordered the shuttle to take off and sneak towards the docking bay door, keeping the noise to a minimum like a church mouse who had recently graduated from ninja training school.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The shuttle lurched backwards and nearly reversed into the wall behind him.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"Ah, then this one must be forward then.\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The dog buried its head in between its legs, and Alex tried again.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"He soared out of the hexagonal bay and crossed the gulf towards the open docking bay door, and looked back to see how foolish he had been in thinking there were only a few shuttles. He now saw the hive of similar hexagonal bays and the masses of shuttles. He also saw several Pathfinders trying to set up the tentacle in completely the wrong bay. They had obviously seen him, as they gave up on the tentacle and stared up at him. They made no attempt to scramble towards the shuttles, which made Alex nervous.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"If they were going to stop him, then clearly, they were going to use the disc ship\'s weapons or those of the other ships.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"But this had given him an idea.

That being done, he deployed every single virus he had in his console onto the disc ship\'s systems, whether it had any chance of working or not. He did not have time to select the most appropriate ones and most had some kind of built-in ability to adapt to whatever operating system onto which they were loaded anyway. Then he instructed the shuttles to follow him out of the docking bay door and form a shell around the shuttle he was in to shield him from the laser. He doubted it would last very long, but with any luck, it should get him to the nearest stream.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Now that one or more of his viruses were beginning to run amok in whatever systems it had managed to gain access to, he moved his fleet forward and out of the door. Almost instantly, his shuttle lurched and hit another in front of him, causing him to fall on the floor. From the information returned by his console, it was clear that the shuttle in front had been fired upon. The Pathfinders seemed to have noticed that somebody was borrowing their entire compliment of shuttles. It looked like it came from small weapons fire, rather than from the ship itself. That was a good sign, but the damage done was still enough to render the propulsion system of that shuttle useless.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"From the position in which he fell, he ordered his fleet to advance out of the door and for one of the other shuttles to take the place of the damaged one.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"He noticed with great satisfaction that he had not instantly been killed as he left the disc ship, which strongly suggested that it\'s weapon systems were offline. The viruses were clearly doing their job.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"He thought for a moment whether \'viruses\' was indeed the plural of virus. Maybe it should be \'virii\'? \'Virae\'? V-\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"His console notified him that another shuttle to his left had just disintegrated. The dog, completely oblivious to anything going on outside of the apparent safety of the shuttle let out a yelp as Alex suddenly screamed in a most unmanly fashion. Another shuttle to his left was then also hit.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"He ascertained that the fire must be coming from one of the warships in the direction. He had safety in numbers, and the other shuttles were shielding him for now, but that would not last for long. Sure enough, another one disintegrated.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"He quickly checked to see if there was a better place he could go to shield his mini-fleet from the line of sight of the warship. From what he could see, there did not appear to be anywhere better than where he was. The disc ship was already shielding him from the majority of the Pathfinder fleet. If he moved, the others would have a clear shot at him. If he waited any longer, the others would flank his position, or the disc ship would manage to free up their systems from his viruses. He had hoped that the viruses would eventually propagate themselves to the other ships, but that would take time and would depend on what communication protocols the Pathfinder fleet used and whether they were sensible enough to disconnect themselves from the other ships until they could purge it.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"His only course of action was to scatter the shuttles in different directions and hope he could make it as far as a Strachan current. He still wanted some degree of protection, so he grouped the shuttles into fours and sent them in various directions. In total he had thirty-seven shuttles, giving him nine groups. He had one shuttle left over and was was tempted to put it in his group for the extra shielding, but decided that that would draw attention to his group and instead allocated it to one of the neighbouring groups. As his shuttle lurched forward with an unhealthy acceleration, he made sure to throw in the occasional random change of direction, to make the Pathfinder\'s target practice just that little bit harder.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The plan seemed to be working. The Pathfinders gave chase, but he was lucky enough to not be in a group selected by each of the seven functional Pathfinder ships.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Alex checked his console for information of the nearest Strachan current so he could make a run for it. On a hunch, he also pulled in data from the Pathfinder shuttle. It was teaming with up-to-date information on nearby Strachan currents, hundreds of them.

By now, the group containing the fifth shuttle had now been destroyed and the pursuing Pathfinder would now be looking for another group to eliminate, and his group was the closest. If he hung around any longer, they would pick off each and every shuttle, including the one he was in. He was not too far from a stream - it was not going anywhere near where his crew had left him. Even so, if he made any obvious movement towards a stream then they would know which shuttle he was in. Suddenly, he had an idea: Using his new-found data, he selected a shuttle closest to a Strachan current - any Strachan current. There were so many to choose from, and he had so many shuttles available, that it was not difficult to find a shuttle that was practically on top of one. There were other candidates, but he ordered that one shuttle to enter the stream and then made all other shuttles - his own included - to stop. The shuttle entered the stream while the others were left to drift.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The Pathfinders took the bait. The four warships moved towards the point at which his decoy shuttle entered the Strachan current, and entered in pursuit.

He had come a long way in the seventeen hours that his console had informed him that he had been held captive by the Pathfinders, but he could follow the path that they had laid back to where his crew had left him. Alex sent out one final set of commands to all of his remaining shuttles: he ordered each of them to move to a different, nearby Strachan current, arriving at the same time he arrived at the path. Once they were all in place, they were all to enter simultaneously.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The shuttles all suddenly came alive and started moving in different directions. The crews of the three ring ships had presumably thought that the shuttle that was carrying Alex had escaped already, and so did not expect them to begin this mass exodus.

He tried not to be worried, and to push it to the back of his mind, but the path still made him nervous. There was still so much that they did not know about travelling along these stretches of deformed space-time created by the overlap between two different universes, while the Pathfinders knew so much that they were able to build their own. It should have reassured him that he was in a Pathfinder shuttle then, but traversing the streams in a shuttle had always previously meant gambling with his life. He did now know if it would make the journey any safer because he was in a path, or because the shuttle was Pathfinder technology, or if he was still in as much danger as he normally would be and he was just trying to convince himself that he would be okay because he was desperate.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"The shuttle came with its own set of problems, though. In this case the shuttle was entirely empty except for himself, the dog and a volume defyingly large pile of faeces left by the dog in the corner. He had been unable to work out how to display an external projection and there were not even any windows to take his mind off things. Not that Alex would be able to see anything out of a real window while in a stream, but sometimes he just like to stare out at the black void. It was probably for the best anyway, as Alex might have been tempted to open one to let out the smell.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"In its favour, he knew that Pathfinder technology would potentially allow him to travel much faster than he would in an Un-designed ship, and even to accelerate. However, he did not know if the Pathfinder shuttle also had this ability or not, and if it did, he had no idea if it he had to do something special to activate it. He wondered if this was something unique to paths or if it also applied to normal Strachan currents as well. In any case, he could not find any hint of being able to turn it on via his wrist console, so he could only hope that it was available and in use. He also hoped that it would not be necessary, but for all he knew, the Pathfinder ring ships were right behind him.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"It was entirely possible that they were about to destroy him, or that they were just waiting for him to exit the path first and then and destroy him then. It was also possible that they had not worked out that he was in the shuttle that was heading back the way he came. Surely, they would have worked out by now that he would be returning the way he came to meet up with his ship? But they were alien, with a completely different set of assumptions. For instance, the shuttle seemed to be holding up very well in the path - maybe they would not think prolonged travel in a shuttle was suicide, as Alex would under normal conditions? If so, then they may have assumed that he could have been in any of the shuttles heading to one of any number of different locations? There must have been lots of confusion because Alex had successfully managed to split up their fleet and steal all of their shuttles from the disc ship, and they could not follow them all.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"No, it was dangerous for Alex to think that way. For all he knew, their other ships may have had enough spare shuttles that they could send one in each direction after each of the decoy shuttles once they got their act together?

Too many, in fact: it was dangerous being so close to all of the debris from the destroyed Nedic outpost. But it was also a good place to hide. Appropriately enough, this particular large, floaty thing was a curved section of the shuttle bay of the station, and he matched his speed and rotation so as to attach his shuttle to the inside of it.\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"All the while, he had one eye on the region of space where the path intersected, looking out for any pursuing Pathfinders.

The smaller of the two looked wonderfully familiar and could not repress a manic laugh. The dog buried its head beneath its leg once again, regretting its decision not to stay with the giant, alien monsters. Alex quickly instructed his wrist console to transmit via the stolen shuttle.

That path forms a bottle neck - there\'s no way around it. That much we knew. What we didn\'t know is that it also means there are squillions more streams away from that point in space than normal. Here\'s some data I extracted from the Pathfinder systems - I don\'t know how they do it, but they\'ve mapped all of them. Their models are way more accurate than ours - I used it to escape so I know it\'s accurate. Plug it into our models and find us the best through there with the least chance of contact.

It\'s a factory ship, all completely automated,\\\\\\" said Euan, \\\\\\"That\'s what I do. I\'m in the salvage business. I find derelicts and use these drones to identify and remove valuable components, then there\'s a different type of drone that chops up whatever\'s left and separates it into different materials. They then drag these parts back to my ship to be melted down ready to be sold. The components will usually go for a good price if I sell them to the less developed races, and there\'s always a buyer for raw materials if I take it to the smaller, more remote stations where they don\'t have their own mining facilities. Alternatively, I can use it to make more drones to replace damaged ones.\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Then Gino chipped in, \\\\\\"But we want to use them for something else.\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"Alex began to see their logic, \\\\\\"You were planning to use them to finish what we started, right?\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"Right. Before we ran into you, we were going to use these ones to get some recon data,\\\\\\" said Gino, pointing at the five multi-armed, self-propelled robots in front of him.

Euan, how long will it take to get as much material to make these drones?\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"My bays are already full. Right now, it\'s making new drones as fast as it can. It\'s the processing of the materials that takes the time. The drones are just topping up the cargo bay by replacing the raw material as it gets used.\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"So we could move now?\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"Shouldn\'t we wait?\\\\\\" asked Ava, \\\\\\"If this data has what we need, and it sounds like it does, then we could build an army of these things all equipped with defences against the Pathfinders\' weaponry.\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"Shouldn\'t that be a navy? Anyway, look, these drones are great, but we don\'t have enough stuff that goes bang to take out eight Pathfinder ships, even with all the ordinance from the Nedic graveyard. The field generators are close to the surface of the disc ship, so we can use it to disrupt their ability to enter a stream, like we planned, but it\'s not going enough to do any damage. That thing is virtually empty on the inside and all of the sensitive stuff is buried deep in the middle.\\\\\\" Alex paused for breath, then directed his next question to Euan, \\\\\\"I\'m assuming that the rest of these drones would just do what they normally do?\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"They strip the target ship apart, piece by piece. Your colleagues showed me the footage of the disc ship: It would take a long time take it apart\\\\\\"\\"), mdx(\\"p\\", null, \\"\\\\\\"I\'m afraid we can\'t wait then. It\'s a great idea - it really is, and believe me, I\'d much rather do this more prepared, but we\'re going to need a lot more drones, a lot more time and a lot more help. Otherwise, they\'re just going to get shot, one-by-one. The Pathfinders fleet is scheduled to hit The Village in less than three weeks. We need to stick with the original plan and get back home to warn everybody.
